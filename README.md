Exercises accomplished in the System Development course at SENAI Manuel Garcia Filho during the first semester in order to learn the concepts of Object Oriented Programming. All files are commented. As a susgestion, you can take a look in folder 'Exercicio Cadastro' because this exercise envolved a lot of concepts that we learned in classes.
